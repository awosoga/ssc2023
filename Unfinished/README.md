This is a folder of ideas that we did not have the time or expertise to fully implement before the case study submission. Anyone interested in extending this project can use these files as a headstart.

1.  [DA_RNN.ipynb](https://github.com/awosoga/ssc2023/blob/4afe31c66eefefd91e665ae7dfc2022a73510ed6/Unfinished/DA_RNN.ipynb) is our attempt at adapting a [dual-stage attention based recurrent neural network for time series prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02971) based on the implementation by [Vatsalya Chaubey](https://github.com/vatch123/DA_RNN). We had planned to use it to forecast productivity growth rate as a response of our climate anomaly features to see which regions had the largest potential for subsequent economic impact of rapidly changing climate.
2.  [Granger Causality Detrended.R](https://github.com/awosoga/ssc2023/blob/4afe31c66eefefd91e665ae7dfc2022a73510ed6/Unfinished/Granger%20Causality%20Detrended.R) was an attempt to implement [Granger Causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality), a statistical hypothesis test useful for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. The script uses the climate anomaly and productivity data after a seasonal trend decomposition and is fully parallelized and takes a long time since it is multivariate.
3.  [SPATIAL.ipynb](https://github.com/awosoga/ssc2023/blob/03219c8ed7a2a321263e3374f89c2edd6df443ac/Unfinished/SPATIAL.ipynb) was an attempt to implement a [spatiotemporal LSTM](https://github.com/IBM/spatial-lstm) to forecast climate anomalies and input them into the DA_RNN.
4.  [Seasonal Trend Decomposition.R](https://github.com/awosoga/ssc2023/blob/7d0044266574ae007c5b566e0b57252a9ee1105f/Unfinished/Seasonal%20Trend%20Decomposition.R) is a parallelized script for decomposing the climate anomaly (and productivity data) into its seasonal, trend, and random components for use in the Granger Causality Script.
